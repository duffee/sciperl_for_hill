# Learning Scientific Programming with _Perl_
_a Hill to Sci on?_

This repository contains translations into Perl for Christian Hill's
[Learning Scientific Programming with Python](https://scipython.com/book2/)
using Perl Data Language (PDL).

I haven't read the book yet.  I assume you have it.
I just like Perl and am converting book examples to help me learn PDL.

## Roadmap
* Get the Numpy examples working in simple PDL scripts
* Use Jupyter notebooks to mix text and code like the Examples website.
* Reproduce the Blog posts

## Plotting

There are so many options on plotting with Perl.
I'm going to try as many as I can, so you can choose the one you like most.
